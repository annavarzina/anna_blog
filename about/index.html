    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I am currently a PhD candidate in mathematics and civil engineering at KULeuven. My learning path started in the field of applied mathematics and computing and continued through porous media numerical modelling up to the study of chemical processes in cements from both experimental and modelling point of view. You may have a look on my <a href="http://www.kempest.site/cv.html">CV</a> here if interested.</p>
<p>I am interested in data science and data processing, visualization, analysis, modelling, machine learning, statistics and big data. I am inspired by science, data, visualization, design, art and statistics. I am driven by creativity, arrangement, beauty and balance.</p>
<p>Data science and machine learning fascinates me from the point of its possibilities and applications. I find data beautiful and believe that simplicity is a solution to most of the problems.</p>
<p>Actually, I think that every person should master as many skills as possible. Therefore, in my daily life I have a huge variety of hobbies and interests including reading, photography, fitness and even handcrafting (see that nice word cloud made with ggplot). That is why I never get bored.</p>
<p>I am starting this blog to share my knowledge in mathematics, modelling, statistics, programming (mainly in R and Python) and data science. During all the time of my studying from bachelor to PhD I always had an inspiring cases that really worth sharing. That is why this blog exists and that reminds me about Leo Tolstoy&rsquo;s quote &ldquo;You should write only when you cannot help but write&rdquo; (in his diary from October 19th, 1909) and this is truly my story. I cannot help but write this blog ðŸ˜€</p>
