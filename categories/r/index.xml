      <description>Preview Correlation analysis is a common method for studying a relationship between two variables and data exploration. Here I do not intend to explain in much details the theoretical part of the correlation analysis but I want to provide several practical examples where this method is applicable or not. For that purpose, I will generate simple datasets in R, create plots and discuss the obtained results.
If you are more interested in the theory of correlation analysis or tools for correlation analsis in R or other programming languages, I would refer to another works then.</description>
