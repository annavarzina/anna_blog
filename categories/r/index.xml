      <description>Website within a few code lines This is a quick tutorial on how to create a blog with R and deploy it in Github Pages. I assume that R and Rstudio are already installed on your PC. If not, here is a link on how to set up the environment. Steps below are done in Rstudio.
Step 1. Install blogdown and hugo themes. At first, letâ€™s run these two commands in console.</description>

      <description>Preview Correlation analysis is a common method for studying a relationship between two variables and data exploration. Here I do not intend to explain in much details the theoretical part of the correlation analysis but I want to provide several practical examples where this method is applicable or not. For that purpose, I will generate simple datasets in R, create plots and discuss the obtained results.
If you are more interested in the theory of correlation analysis or tools for correlation analsis in R or other programming languages, I would refer to another works then.</description>
